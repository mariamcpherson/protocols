<h1>Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
<p>
Internet protocols are a set of rules and conventions that govern the communication and data exchange between devices over the internet. These protocols facilitate the smooth transfer of data packets and ensure that different devices and systems can understand and interact with each other.
</p>
<p>
In this tutorial, we observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark.
<p><br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Windows Server 2022

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>

- Install Wireshark on Windows 10 VM
- Step 2
- Step 3
- Step 4

<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>

For this tutorial we are going to use Wireshark, which is a widely used open-source network protocol analyzer and packet capture tool. It is also known as a network sniffer or packet sniffer. Wireshark allows users to capture and inspect network packets in real-time or from saved capture files. It is available for various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. 
</p>
<p>
Wireshark is a powerful tool used by network administrators, security professionals, and developers for a wide range of purposes, such as network troubleshooting, monitoring network performance, analyzing security incidents, and understanding network behavior. However, it's essential to use Wireshark responsibly, as capturing network traffic may involve legal and privacy considerations.
